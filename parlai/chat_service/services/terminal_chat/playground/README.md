# Client-Server
A simple toy example of a client-server communication to understand the implementation better.
The code was used from a [tutorial](https://pymotw.com/3/socket/tcp.html).

**Note:** Remove this directory before merging ```term_chat```

## Usage
Currently the message being sent is pre-set in ```client.py```, but we should improve this example
in order to get closer to the chatbot like implementation we want eventually

### Step 1
Run ```server.py```

### Step 2
Run ```client.py```
